# Malicious or Benign Website Prediction using Machine Learning
Machine Learning project for the course DVA439 Intelligent systems at MÃ¤lardalen University. The project aims to predict whether a Website is malicious or benign based on different features which can be extracted from the URL. To determine which features have high variance a genetic algorithm for feature selection is implemented. Based on the features selected, six different ML models will be created and their respective prediction scores are later compared. The project consisted of the following steps:
1. Feature engineering of our dataset
2. Feature selection with the help of Genetic Algorithm (GA)
3. Train the machine learning models with selected features from GA
4. Evaluate and compare the prediction scores from the machine learning models
